Andrew Borden and his wife Abby are found dead in Fall River, Massachusetts on the morning of August 4th, 1892. Their daughter Lizzie is the main suspect. Tried but acquitted of the crime, the story goes that she wielded the axe that killed them. Overnight, she becomes Americas original mad, bad and dangerous to know icon of tabloid and rumor. Set to prairie bluegrass music, and fusing folktale, nursery rhyme and Vaudevillian horror,  Bury the Hatchet will settle the age-old question: Did Lizzie escape the hangmans noose? And is Andrew and Abbys blood truly on her hands? This new work by London-based playwright Sasha Wilson will make its Western Hemisphere premiere at Taliesin West.","http://1sd06y38jhbh1xhqve6fqmc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hatchetheader-1024x460.jpg","-1"
