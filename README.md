# mcprogrammersEasyExpress
This is a project for the Midland College Programmers Group. We're using it learn some of the basics of Node.js and Express. 

Anyone who would like to use this starter is welcome to use it. 

To get the project up and running:
1) Clone the project
2) CD into the project directory
3) Run `npm install`
4) Then run `node app.js` - will start the server which will run on localhost:8000, kill the server with `control + C` in the terminal
5) You can also run `nodemon app` and the server will restart automatically when any changes are made to the code
6) "/" is the home route, "/about" will show mock about page, "*" anything else will take you to the error page
-- Happy Coding!
